	============================= GAME LOOPS

    Potential / Inspired Game Loops:

    1) Harvest Moon / Animal Crossing (High Impact)
        - Town development and customization
        - Non-violent work
        - Acquire new plots of land in order to modify
        - Community relationships and events
        - Characters very very rarely die: or the community is meaningless

    2) Retro Zelda / Roguelike (Medium Impact)
        - Wilderness and Dungeon exploration
        - Combat
        - Can't modify terrain, can only explore it
        - Finding Loot: New exploration gear, weapons, armor, gold

	3) Sim / Civ / Dwarf Fortress (Medium Impact)
        - Civilization Development
        - Control a large number of AI by issuing commands or responsibilities
        - Dynamics of different groups interacting and fighting, animals or humanoid
        - Deaths and births of civilization are common
        
    4) Minecraft / Starbound (Medium Impact)
        - Full voxel terrain modification
        - Combat
        - Survival Elements
        - Generated World
        - Mining

    5) Party Games / Overcooked / Mario Party (Low Impact - Let players create and play unofficial, non-coded games, ie spleef)
        - Contained Arena
        - Timer
        - Win conditions
        - Simple Mechanics

    How these elements can fit together into The Game:
	- The world is seperated into contained zones, which are randomly generated at the start
	- Zones may either be unclaimed wilderness, or owned by a Community
	- The player starts in a small community owning one zone, can explore the surrounding wilderness and claim more plots
	- The player has a lot of modification control over zones they own, but is unable to modify much if anything in zones they dont own
	- NPCs in a community are safe within their own zones, if attacked they are simply incapacitated but can not die
	- NPCs can be given jobs, including adventuring with a player outside of claimed zones, and to caravan to seperate owned zones
	- NPCs can die when outside of a zone, but players have a good control over who is taking that risk
	- There is a lot of nonviolent work that can be done within claimed zones, such as farming, cooking, fishing, etc. Players or NPCs can do these tasks
	- Resources can be gained by going out into the wilderness, but some resource hotspots may be worth claiming and setting up shop there
	- Opposing community zones can be found and entered, but they are tough as the same rules apply, they cant be killed, and you cant modify their terrain.
	- New community members can be recruited or born, and community members may die when putting themselves at risk.
	- Bigger communities require more resources. An equilibrium can be met where a community is set up to feed itself, farming manually can increase that pool for extra or if the NPC productivity is not high enough yet.
	- Community members can level up in certain professions to become better at them
	- The amount of "death/countdown timer" should be carefully weighed, in order to enable slowing down and enjoying the community from within, without risk of starving and dieing. Harvest Moon & Animal Crossing > Survival games!

	Game Loops:

	1) Professions and Tools: Farming, Mining, Cooking, Smithing, Lumberjacking, Hunting, Tailoring, etc.
		Community members can specialize and level up in these, doing them as a day-to-day job
		Players can interact with these same systems in the same way, usually much more efficiently

	2) Community
		Resource pools: Food, Minerals, Wood, Morale, Population, etc.
		Claimed zones, trade routes(?)
		Foreign Politics: Relations with other communities that they have come into contact with
		Domestic Politics: Leadership (Player or AI), Laws, Events, Resident relations

	3) Community Buildings: Workshops, Farms, Houses, Public Buildings, Gardens, Graveyard, etc
		Built and modified by player, or generated by AI leader
		Requirements: Building size, required props, doors, etc.
		Inhabitants: Like zones, but for residents and families. Either unclaimed or owned by a specific family

	4) World Generation and Exploration

	5) Combat, Weapons, Loot

	6) Terrain Modification and Construction
		Less modular than minecraft - not just building buildings and bridges out of wood blocks.
		More modular than AC/HM - not just picking completely prebuilt buildings in a very limited number of spots.
		Recipe based, you can learn and unlock more buildables (and materials) as you progress and explore. Examples:
			- Liquid terrain manipulator, with materials (water, lava, acid)
			- Block terrain manipulator, with materials (earth, cobblestone, wood)
			- Floor manipulation(?) (able to switch earth blocks from grass or dirt floor tops)
			- Bridges and posts of varying styles or pieces (plank, ramp, post)
			- Buildings, with materials (stone, wood, log) and shapes for addons (door hole, window hole)
			- Building addons (doors, windows, roof, chimney) with materials (wood, iron, glass, stained glass, brick, cobblestone)
			- Foliage (flowers, shrubs, trees)
		Construction: Preview blueprints, construction zone, apply resources.
			- Place non-ugly preview buildings when trying to place a construction.
			- Once the construction is placed, the preview is gone, but under-construction model is placed there.
			- Apply resources to the construction site in order to complete the construction.
